# Rubikon

## Basic information
Rubikon is simple application for encryption purpose. Name Rubikon originates from game of combination words, Rubi part came from Ruby, technology I used to create this piece of software, and Rubikon, name of river Caesar crossed and send encrypted message to his commanders “alea iacta est”. This piece of software is created in proccess of learning Ruby language. Alphabet used in this first version is English. There are  26 letters, and this is important for properly usage. Software have option to encrypt and decrypt text.  

## Purpose
Rubikon goal is to implement Caesar chiper in this langaguge. This chiper is used in antique, and is not recommened in modern-day use, but show excellent how basic  “substitution chiper” works. This type of chiper works shifting all letters in alphabet for some others letters. Idea behind this type of chiper is to person who want to hide message choose key and encrypt message with that key. Key is number of shiffting in alphabet. Only persons who know key can decrypt message. 

## Weakness
This type of cheaper is used in antique, in time when majority of peoples didn’t know to read, and possibility to someone encrypt and “break” message was low. Caesar chiper is break in the mid of 19th century only with “brute force” tehnique. But in modern-day, when computer power is more and more advanced, “breaking” this type of chiper is trivial. Tehnique that is used to “break” is tehnique of frequency analysis. Idea behind this tehnique is to compares letters from chipers that appears most often with letters in language that is appears most. Letters that are most used are vowels. Comparing these letters we can predict key of chiper. It is strongly recommended to use modern-day algorithms to encrypt informations.
